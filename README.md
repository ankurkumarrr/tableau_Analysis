# Revenue_Analysis
I have created a Tableau dashboard that is linked to an SQL Workbench database. This dashboard is part of a sales insights data analysis project, offering a glimpse into the typical workflow of such projects in large organizations.

The project revolves around a case study involving a computer hardware business that faces challenges in a rapidly changing market. To initiate the analysis, I conducted data discovery on our sales insights data, which is stored in a MySQL database. This database contains valuable information related to sales transactions, customers, products, and markets.

Once I connected the MySQL database to Tableau, I proceeded with data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, commonly referred to as data munging or data wrangling. This involved tasks like currency normalization and handling invalid values.
